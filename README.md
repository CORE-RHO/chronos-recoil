# CHRONOS-RECOIL
Entropy rots your system clock; this is the cure. A portable, zero-overhead strike against time drift and CMOS battery death. One click pulls the absolute truth from global NTP servers and hammers it into your OS. No menus, no navigation, just cold, hard synchronization. Command your timeline.

**PROJECT: CHRONOS-RECOIL**

**STATUS:** UNOPTIMIZED / LETHAL / FUNCTIONAL

**TARGET:** WINDOWS 7 (MODDED/VANILLA) + WIN 10/11 COMPATIBLE

### **THE PHILOSOPHY**

Your hardware is dying. Your CMOS battery is a chemical corpse. Your OS is hallucinating the date. In a world of safe "best practices," your system clock is drifting into the void. **CHRONOS-RECOIL** is the anchor. It pulls the absolute timestamp from global NTP Stratum servers and hammers it into your registry.

### **OPERATIONAL INTEL**

* **Zero-Footprint:** No installer. No bloat. Just the `.exe`.
* **The "Wait" Protocol:** This isn't optimized for your dopamine-fried attention span. It takes time to initialize. If it feels stuck, **wait.** If you're impatient, use an auto-clicker to spam the execution—force the gate open.
* **Connectivity:** NTP is not a suggestion; it’s a requirement. If you aren't on the grid, the app will scream an error. Give it internet or give it death.
* **Legacy First:** Engineered for Windows 7 because modern "Auto-Sync" is either broken or missing in your modded ISOs.

### **EXECUTION STEPS**

1. **Deploy:** Run `TimeFixer.exe` on startup.
2. **Calibrate:** Select your timezone from the interface.
3. **Synchronize:** Watch the temporal drift vanish.

### **TECHNICAL WARNINGS**

* **Dead CMOS Support:** Designed specifically for power users running legacy rigs where the hardware has failed but the spirit is willing.
* **The Abomination Factor:** If you're looking for a polished corporate utility, leave. This is for the ones who refuse to let a dead battery dictate their system's reality.

* **THE CODE IS DEAD. > I cooked this up, served it, and burned the kitchen down. The source is gone—lost to the same entropy this app fights. You’re looking at a standalone temporal executioner with no paper trail. Is it safe? Is it optimized? Who cares. It works. Trust me or deal with your dead CMOS. Your move, power user.
